model_description: |
  This is a supervised classification task for credit default risk model. The objective is to use historical loan application data to predict whether or not an applicant will be able to repay a loan. The target is a 0 for the loan was repaid on time, or a 1 indicating the client had payment difficulties. There are over 750 features/input variables that includes CODE_GENDER, FLAG_OWN_CAR, AMT_INCOME_TOTAL, AMT_CREDIT, NAME_EDUCATION_TYPE, OCCUPATION_TYPE and NAME_HOUSING_TYPE.


# Write-up on explainability findings
explainability: |
  EXT_SOURCE_2, EXT_SOURCE_3, EXT_SOURCE_1 are scores derived from past records of the client transactions with our bank. Thus, they are important predictors, which are correctly reflected in the feature importance plots.


# Write-up on conclusion
conclusion:
  model_performance: |
    As the precision and recall values are above 70%, the model is considered performing well.
  explainability: |
    Having reviewed the plots in Section 4, we have assessed that the prohibited features do not contribute significantly to the model performance. The direction of the feature impact is also as expected. We are confident that if asked to explain the key factors in the model, a clear explanation can be given to stakeholders and customers.
